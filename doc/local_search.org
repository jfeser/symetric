* Combining bottom-up enumeration and local search

We hypothesize that an enumerative synthesis procedure can be improved by
combining standard bottom-up enumeration with a heuristic local search. We
consider local search techniques such as hill climbing that are effective at
finding solutions when they start in an appropriate region, but are unable to
find solutions when starting from scratch. We make use of an interesting
property of many of these algorithms to combine them with our enumeration
procedure.

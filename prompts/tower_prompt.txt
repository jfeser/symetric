You are an expert programmer. You write programs in a domain-specific language called TOWERS.
TOWERS is a language for building towers out of blocks.
Each program controls a robotic arm that can move left and right and can drop horizontal or vertical blocks.

The TOWERS language has the following operators:
- `(l n)` moves the arm left `n` spaces.
- `(r n)` moves the arm right `n` spaces.
- `(h)` drops a horizontal block.
- `(v)` drops a vertical block.
- `(for n p)` executes the program `p` `n` times.
- `(embed p)` executes the program `p` and then resets the position of the arm to what it was before `p` was executed.
- `(p1 p2 p3 ... pn)` executes programs in sequence, starting with `p1`.

Running a TOWERS program produces a sequence of values "x y k", where "x" and "y" are the position of a block and "k" is either 'h' for a horizontal block or 'v' for a vertical block.

Write a TOWERS program that generates the following output.

Output:

((for 4 v h (r 2) v (l 2) h))

* DONE Vectorize pairwise distance calculation (cnorm)
* DONE Figure out why vectorized embedding & search threshold is behaving weird
* TODO Figure out how to compare quality of learned distance w/ jaccard
* DONE Learn a distance function with a larger training set
* DONE Use online triplet selection to deal with collapsing model

* DONE Implement renaming rewriter
* DONE Implement push-pull rewriter
* DONE Split rewriters into collections of rewrite rules
* TODO Implement test for local rewriters (random walk, then try to get back)
** DONE Sample programs, apply all rewrites, record distances, repeat 
** TODO Save rules with distances and use as weighted rewriter
* TODO Try rotation/mirror invariant distances

- for tensor benchmarks, much of the improvement comes from reducing the number of vectors that will never be used
  - vectors of size k grow as (num ints)^k, if the target program has max vector
    size k', anything larger than k' can be discarded completely
  - its cheaper to guess that than it is to search through those vectors
    exhaustively
* DONE dump test cases for vantage point trees (query & reference sets)
* DONE try using neighbor queries for finding range results
* DONE figure out dual tree algorithm for range results
* DONE Use VP tree to query reference and to cluster the query points (pack together vantage point w/ close points when they are close enough)
* DONE Local search using search state
** DONE Random program selection needs to be depth bounded or cost bounded
** DONE Modify search state to make this possible

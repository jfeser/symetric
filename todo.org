- for tensor benchmarks, much of the improvement comes from reducing the number of vectors that will never be used
  - vectors of size k grow as (num ints)^k, if the target program has max vector size k', anything larger than k' can be discarded completely
  - its cheaper to guess that than it is to search through those vectors exhaustively
* TODO Investigate knuth-bendix for grouping

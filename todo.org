* DONE Vectorize pairwise distance calculation (cnorm)
* DONE Figure out why vectorized embedding & search threshold is behaving weird
* TODO Figure out how to compare quality of learned distance w/ jaccard
* DONE Learn a distance function with a larger training set
* DONE Use online triplet selection to deal with collapsing model
